Building can be done via Maven:
Prerequisite:
You will need to locally install some libraries to Maven. There is a script in the lib directory to help.

Linux/OSX:
Replace the 'swt' directory in the pom.xml for the respective operating system.


$ mvn clean package

It will create an executable jar in the target directory (otertool-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar).
